## Nishiawakura Forest Management Plan

## Policy and Objectives
　The forest managers of Nishiawakura Village aim to create a "high quality countryside" where forests can be used for multiple purposes and sustainable economic circulation can take place. This is based on the "One Hundred Year Forest Concept" conceived in Nishiawakura Village in 2006. The "Hyakunen-no-Morin (One Hundred Year Forest) Concept" states, "Let's not give up on the forests that have grown to 50 years old, and let's work hard for another 50 years with the whole village. The vision is to create a high-quality countryside surrounded by beautiful 100-year old forests. Nishiawakura Village's forest management is based on this vision.  

## Forest Management Certification
　This plan will obtain Forest Management Certification (FM Certification) from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®), and will be managed in accordance with the principles and standards of the FSC, whose mission is to manage forests in a manner that is environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically sustainable. The FSC is consistent with the objectives of this plan.  

## Scope
　This plan covers forests that have been entrusted for long-term management under the "Centennial Forest Project". The "100-year forest project" is a village project based on the "100-year forest concept," which enables stable forest management over the long term by integrating forest maintenance, lumbering, and wood processing into a unified cycle within the village. A map of the management area can be viewed as the "Nishiawakura Forest Management Map.  

## Natural Situation
　Nishiawakura Village is located in the northeastern corner of Okayama Prefecture and is a mountain village in a valley opened on the southern slope of the Chugoku Mountains. The village is located at the headwaters of the Yoshino River, a tributary of the Yoshii River system, and the Yoshino River flows through the center of the village. Along the Yoshino River, a long and narrow plain spreads out, and farmlands and villages are formed. The area of planted cedar and cypress forests has expanded since the period of afforestation around 1960, and the details can be seen in the Nishiawakura Village Forest Map. Most of the planted forests in the village were planted around 1960.  
 
## Other evaluation status
### Multifunctional Functions
　In addition to timber production, forests are closely related to our daily lives by securing water resources, preventing floods and landslides, and providing forest recreational opportunities. In addition, as global environmental conservation becomes a common international issue, the role of forests and timber in fixing carbon dioxide, preventing global warming, and contributing to the creation of a recycling-oriented society is being reevaluated. In particular, there are many forests in Nishiawakura that have been designated as safety forests for their water source recharge function. In addition, in areas close to private homes, the forests are required to fulfill their functions of mountain disaster prevention and soil conservation.  

### Social Resources
　Access to forests is not actively encouraged, with the exception of the Wakasugi Natural Forest. The Wakasugi Natural Forest has well-maintained footpaths and signage, and is accessible to all and promoted as a natural tourist resource. However, local residents are not restricted from entering the forest and collecting non-wood forest products. Cypress bark for dyeing cloth, firewood, cedar leaves for cedar balls, game and traps for selling deer meat, and mushrooms are some of the resources used by local communities. As for cultural resources, shrines and other sites are scattered throughout the village, and their status has been confirmed along with forest improvement.  

### Socio-Environmental Risks
　The habitats of wild animals and plants are affected by various human activities and global climate change. In Nishiawakura Village, some wild animals and plants are in danger of extinction, and conservation activities are required based on the Okayama Prefecture Red Data Book. The map in the Red Data Book includes sighting locations, but the scale is too small to be useful. It is preferable to assume that these species are likely to be present in all forests in Nishiawakura, as they are indicated to be found throughout the forests of the village.  

### Ecosystems and old-growth forests
　All forests contribute to biodiversity conservation as habitats for a wide variety of organisms. Based on this, and based on the concept of adaptive management that takes into account the uncertainties of forest ecosystems, forests should be balanced, consisting of various growth stages and tree species that are suited to the unique natural conditions of the land in a certain extent, while constantly changing through moderate disturbance throughout the time axis. In particular, the primary forest ecosystems found in natural young cedar forests must be preserved as forests that maintain and promote the function of biodiversity conservation. Appropriate conservation should also be promoted, taking into consideration the need to secure corridors for wildlife.  

### Disease and Insect Control
　As risks in forest management, in Nishiawakura Village, "oak wilt" (caused by oak oak oak warbler) and "feeding damage by Japanese sika deer" (caused by deer) are increasing. The basic countermeasure for oak wilt is to inhibit the proliferation of oak and ambrosia fungi by injecting chemicals, but other countermeasures will also be considered and tested as needed to reduce the frequency, range, and amount of chemical pesticides used. Regarding damage caused by deer, the basic measure is to use deer fences, but it should be noted that this does not lead to deer population control and is not a fundamental countermeasure. Therefore, other countermeasures, such as increasing hunting pressure in the forest, will be considered and experimented with as needed.
 
### Forests with high conservation value
　Nishiawakura Village designates forests with high conservation value based on the following evaluation axes: species diversity, ecosystem and mosaic at the landscape level, ecosystem and habitat/growing areas, essential ecosystem services, local community needs, and cultural value. Forests with high conservation values are re-evaluated every five years with reference to the Forest Stewardship Council's (FSC®) FSC-STD-JPN-01.1-2020a. The currently designated forest areas are as follows
- Young cedar virgin forest (1145-1 Ochaya, etc.)

## Management Plan
　The forest manager of Nishiawakura Village shall promote consolidation of forests in Nishiawakura Village and conduct forest management in accordance with the village's "Centennial Forest Project". Consolidation will be carried out by entering into a long-term contract for forest management services. The management of the consolidated forests will be based on a forest management plan. Specific forest management will be based on the "Basic Specifications for the Construction of the Centennial Forest Planting Project" (https://hyakumori.github.io/Nishiawakura_FM_Documents/hyakumorispecs). Typical harvesting methods and equipment used will be established to comply with FSC principles and standards, which will be specified in the specifications.  
　The plan shall include the following: compliance with laws and regulations; maintenance or enhancement of the social and economic well-being of workers6; maintenance or enhancement of the social and economic well-being of local communities; maintenance or enhancement of forest benefits; maintenance or restoration of the multiple functions of the management area; maintenance or enhancement of the high conservation values within the management area; and appropriate monitoring and evaluation. Adhere to the criteria for forest management certification, including appropriate monitoring and evaluation. If endangered species are detected in the management, procedures for their protection will be developed by the manager.
 Social, environmental, and cultural considerations in management, particularly in the design of practices, such as the establishment of river buffer zones, shall be identified in a pre-operation checklist.

## Achievement Targets
　The forest managers of Nishiawakura Village shall aim to achieve the following goals, which will be developed based on the above management policy. Periodic monitoring will be conducted to confirm and evaluate the progress of these goals. The details of monitoring shall be described in the ["Nishiawakura Forest Management Monitoring Chart"](https://hyakumori.github.io/Nishiawakura_FM_Documents/monitoringsheet).  

### Workers
　Nishiawakura forest managers shall provide at least one education/announcement opportunity per year on workers' rights, occupational health and safety, and gender equality. Education shall be provided to all operators involved and records shall be kept. Safety shall be managed through "safety checklists" and "work logbooks" in addition to supervision of operations.  

### Forest Maintenance
　At least 2% of the total managed area shall be cleared annually. The maximum annual clearcutting area is 18 ha for cedar and 16 ha for cypress. These limits are based on the results of the 2017 survey. The compliance with the FSC Principles and Criteria will be checked in the design of the project using a "pre-operation checklist", and the actual compliance will be verified by the operation supervisor and documented in a "supervision logbook".  

### Timber Yield
　An average of at least 10 cubic meters of harvested timber per hectare of forest area per year.  

### Linkage with Local Communities
　At least once a year, the forest manager of Nishiawakura Village will hold an event or presentation related to forest maintenance in which local residents can participate. At these events, interested parties may express any opinions, requests, complaints, etc. regarding management activities to the forest manager. The forest manager will respond with consultation or other measures according to the content.  

## Suspension of management activities
　In the event of a major conflict, a prolonged conflict, or a conflict involving a large number of interests, operations will be suspended. The conflict shall be resolved through consultation among the parties concerned, including the Nishiawakura Village Office, with the forest manager as the point of contact.
