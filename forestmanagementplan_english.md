# Nishiawakura Forest Management Plan

## Policy and objectives
　The forest manager of Nishiawakura Village aims to create a "high-quality countryside" where forests are utilized in multiple ways and a sustainable economic cycle takes place. This is based on the "100-year forest concept" conceived in 2006 in Nishiawakura Village. The "100-year forest concept" calls for the entire village to work together for another 50 years without giving up on forests that have grown to 50 years old. The vision is to realize a high-quality countryside surrounded by beautiful 100-year-old forests. Forest management in Nishiawakura Village is carried out based on this vision.  

## Forest Management Certification
　In this plan, we will obtain Forest Management Certification (FM Certification) from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®), and manage our forests in accordance with its principles and standards. It is consistent with the objectives of this plan.  

## Scope
　The target of this plan shall be the forest which has been entrusted with the long-term operation and management by "Centennial Forest Project". The "Centennial Forest Project" is a village project based on the "Centennial Forest Concept," which enables stable forest management over a long period of time by integrating all processes from forest maintenance to lumbering and wood processing into a single cycle within the village. A map of the management area can be viewed as "Nishiawakura Forest Management Map.  

## Natural conditions
　Nishiawakura Village is located in the northeastern corner of Okayama Prefecture and is a mountain village in a valley on the southern slope of the Chugoku Mountains. The village is located at the headwaters of the Yoshino River, a tributary of the Yoshii River system, and the Yoshino River flows through the center of the village. Along this river, a long and narrow plain spreads out, and agricultural land and villages are formed. In the mountains and forests, the area of planted forests of cedar and cypress has been expanding since the era of expanded afforestation around 1960. Most of the planted forests in the village were planted around 1960.  

## Other evaluation status
## Multifaceted functions
　In addition to timber production, forests have a deep connection with our daily lives by securing water resources, preventing floods and landslides, and providing places for forest recreation. As the preservation of the global environment has become a common international issue, the role of forests and timber in fixing carbon dioxide, preventing global warming, and contributing to the establishment of a recycling-oriented society is being reevaluated. In particular, Nishi Awakura has many forests designated as safety forests for the purpose of water source recharge. In addition, in areas close to private homes, there is a need to demonstrate the functions of mountain disaster prevention and soil conservation.  

### Social Resources
　Access to the forest is not actively encouraged, except in the Wakasugi Natural Forest. In the Wakasugi Natural Forest, footpaths and signboards are in place, and the forest is open to all and advertised as a tourism resource that takes advantage of nature. However, there are no restrictions on local residents entering the forest to collect non-timber forest products. Cypress bark for dyeing cloth, firewood, cedar leaves for cedar balls, hunting and trapping for selling deer meat, and mushrooms are some of the resources utilized by the community. As for cultural resources, shrines and other structures are scattered throughout the village, and their status is being confirmed along with forestation.  

### Socio-environmental risks
　The habitat of wild animals and plants is affected by various human activities and global climate change. In Nishiawakura Village, some wild animals and plants are in danger of extinction, so conservation activities based on the Okayama Red Data Book are required. The maps in the Red Data Book show sighting sites, but the scale is too small to be useful. Since it is indicated that the species can be found in the entire forest of the village, it is desirable to assume that the species may be present in all forests in Nishiawakura.  

### Ecosystems and old-growth forests
　All forests contribute to the conservation of biodiversity as a place where a variety of organisms can grow and live. Based on the concept of adaptive management, which takes into account the uncertainty of forest ecosystems, it is necessary to have a well-balanced arrangement of forests consisting of various growth stages and tree species that are suitable for the natural conditions unique to the land in a certain area, while constantly changing with moderate disturbance throughout the time axis. In particular, the pristine forest ecosystem found in the natural forest of young cedar trees must be preserved as a forest that maintains and enhances biodiversity conservation functions. In addition, it is necessary to promote appropriate conservation that takes into account the securing of corridors for wildlife.  

## Management plan
　Based on the village's "Centennial Forest Project," the forest manager of Nishiawakura Village shall promote the consolidation of forests in Nishiawakura Village and conduct forest management. Consolidation will be carried out by concluding a long-term consignment contract for forest management operations. For the management of the aggregated forests, a forest management plan will be established and managed based on the plan. For specific forest maintenance, the "Basic Specifications for the Construction of the Hyakunen no Shinrin Zukuri Project" (https://hyakumori.github.io/Nishiawakura_FM_Documents/hyakumorispecs) will be prepared and implemented based on its contents. Typical logging methods and equipment to be used shall be specified in the specifications.  
　The plan shall include compliance with laws and regulations, maintenance or improvement of the social and economic well-being of the workers, maintenance or improvement of the social and economic well-being of the local community, maintenance or improvement of the benefits provided by the forest, maintenance or restoration of the multifunctional functions of the management area, maintenance or improvement of the high conservation values within the management area, and appropriate monitoring and evaluation of these. Strictly adhere to the criteria for forest management certification, including appropriate monitoring and evaluation.  

## Achievement target
　The forest manager of Nishiawakura Village shall aim to achieve the following goals, which are developed based on the above management policy. Regular monitoring will be conducted to confirm and evaluate the progress of these goals. The details of monitoring shall be described in the "Nishiawakura Forest Management Monitoring Table" (https://hyakumori.github.io/Nishiawakura_FM_Documents/monitoringsheet).  

### Workers
　Forest managers in Nishiawakura Village shall provide at least one opportunity per year to educate and inform workers about their rights, occupational health and safety, and gender equality. Education shall be provided to all related businesses, and a record shall be kept.  

### Forest maintenance area
　Forest maintenance shall be conducted on at least 2% of the total managed area per year. The maximum annual clearing area shall be 18 ha for Japanese cedar and 16 ha for Japanese cypress. These limits are based on the results of the 2017 survey.  

### Timber harvest volume
　An average of at least 10 cubic meters of harvested wood per hectare will be harvested for the annual forest maintenance area.  

### Linkage with local communities
　At least once a year, the forest manager of Nishiawakura Village will hold an event or briefing session related to forest maintenance in which local residents can participate. At these events, concerned parties can convey to the forest manager any opinions, requests, or complaints regarding management activities. The forest manager shall consult with them and take other actions according to the content.
