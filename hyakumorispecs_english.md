### 9-1. Construction standards for thinning
### 9-1. Thinning
Unless otherwise instructed by the client, qualitative thinning focusing on inferior trees shall be the standard, in order to improve the value of trees in the future and enhance their public interest functions.
### 9-2. Thinning rate
The thinning rate shall be approximately 30% as a percentage of the number of trees, unless otherwise specified by the client according to the number of trees established. The thinning rate shall not vary greatly within the construction area.
### 9-3. Removal range
The removal area for thinning shall be 25m from the work path, and unless removal is considered to be particularly difficult, the thinned wood within the removal area shall be removed as much as possible.
### When felling with a chainsaw, it is necessary to cut the wood at the end.
When felling with a chain saw, always make a catch basin and perform a tailgate cut. However, this does not necessarily apply to standing trees with an end diameter of less than 14 cm.
### 9-5. Length class
The standard length of lumber shall be 4 m, with an extra length of 20 cm or less. However, if the value of the felled tree as a whole is considered to be improved by using 3m, 3m shall be considered and discussed with the client.
### 9-6. Diameter class
The standard diameter grade for sawn timber shall be 16 cm or more. The contractor may dispose of lumber with a diameter of less than 14 cm, but only with the consent of the forest owner.
### 9-7. Logging point
The standard felling point is at the edge of the mountain side. However, in the case of steep slopes, the felling point should be within 30cm from the ground.
### 9-8. Treatment of trapped trees
If a tree is caught, pull it down to the ground on the same day as the work is done. If it is unavoidable to leave them temporarily, mark them with tape to prevent anyone from entering the area, and dispose of them at a later date.
### 9-9. Retaining trees
9-9. Retain hardwoods and dead trees unless they are dangerous. If it is necessary to cut down broadleaf trees growing along streams, report to the contractor.
### 9-10. Protection of remaining trees
9-10. Protection of remaining trees The contractor shall take sufficient care not to damage remaining trees. In case of unavoidable damage, the contractor shall take pictures and report to the client. In principle, the contractor shall not temporarily store materials to be removed while leaning against the remaining trees. If this is not possible, protective measures shall be taken to prevent damage to the remaining trees.

## 10. Construction standards for the establishment and repair of work paths, etc.
### 10-1. Route planning
If any changes are necessary to the plan based on the local topography and soil quality, they shall be made after consultation with the client.
### 10-2. Longitudinal slope
The longitudinal slope shall be less than 18% (10°). The slope shall be less than 18% (10°). If it is unavoidable due to topography, the slope shall be less than 25% (14°) in short sections.
### In principle, the height of cut soil shall be 1.5 m.
In principle, the cut height shall be 1.5 m or less, and the slope shall be 6 minutes as a standard. The slope of the slope shall be 6 minutes as a standard. However, in the case of rocky soil, the standard slope shall be 3 minutes, and direct cutting is acceptable when the cut height is 1.2 meters or less. Standing trees on the cut side should be left in principle, except in cases where there is a risk of falling trees, such as when the roots are severely exposed or damaged, or when the trees are on soil that is prone to collapse, and the cutting width should be kept to a minimum. In addition, at intervals of 100 to 300 m, a ramp should be installed on the mountain side to serve as a climbing path at a low cut height.
### 10-4. Embankment
In principle, the height of fill shall be 2m or less, and the slope of the slope shall be 10%. The slope of the slope shall be 10%. However, when the height of the embankment exceeds 2m, the slope shall be 10% and half. (2) Compaction in the embankment should be done sufficiently after every 30 cm of embankment. The width of the roadway should be minimized by leaving as many standing trees as possible under the roadway, unless it is impossible to do so due to standing trees or root stumps.
### 10-5. Road body
In order to obtain the strength of the road body, compaction of each layer of about 30 cm should be sufficiently carried out by stepwise heaping. In this case, topsoil should be stripped off and organic materials such as topsoil and branches should not be buried in the roadway and embankment, and compaction by caterpillar compaction should be carried out to the edge of the embankment.
### 10-6. Disposal of rootstocks and stubbles
It is standard practice to dispose of rootstocks and stubbles on stable slopes or ridges, rather than burying them in the roadway or embankment. If rootstocks need to be disposed of on the embankment slope, they should be placed at the bottom of the embankment slope so that they are in contact with the ground. In this case, it should be confirmed that the bottom of the embankment slope is on the ground. When branches or leftover materials are unavoidably left on a steep slope, take measures to prevent them from falling or spilling out by using wooden stakes. When leaving materials around the embankment slope of a newly constructed work road, be sure to provide sufficient space for workers to pass through at least once every 20 m. At the same time, prepare the ground so that it can be confirmed that the embankment slope is grounded to the ground.
### 10-7. Ditching and turning areas
The width of the ducking and turning area should be wide enough to allow vehicles to pass each other and to turn around on gentle slopes, ridges, and at the end of insertions.
### 10-8. Width
The width shall be based on the design width, with an excess of up to 30 cm. If there is enough margin in the design width, the first priority shall be to make the cut slope loose rather than to secure the width. However, this does not apply to the ducking and turning areas and hairpin curve sections mentioned in the previous section.
### 10-9. Road surface drainage
The cross slope of the road surface should not be lower on the cut side, and the drainage should be distributed frequently by raising the roadbed in valleys and lowering the roadbed in ridges. In addition, the amount of water drained at a time should be kept as low as possible.
### 10-10. Transverse drainage ditches
When installing cross-sectional drainage ditches, they should be basically dug with bare earth or installed with horizontal trees. The location and spacing of the ditches should be selected according to the longitudinal slope and the degree of water collection, and the ditches should be set at an angle of about 25 degrees to the route, with the cut side higher and the fill side lower. In the vicinity of curves, drainage should be carried out at the entrance to the upper part of the curve, and rainwater inflow into the curve should be avoided as much as possible. When installing sidewalks, use logs that are longer than the width of the road and are less than 14 cm in diameter.
### 10-11. Log assembly work
In principle, the retrofitting of log structures at the time of construction is prohibited.
### 10-12. Alignment
The line shall be designed to follow the topography and keep the height of cut soil as low as possible.
### 10-13. Pre-felling
The felling of trees should be carried out in pairs by the feller and the heavy equipment operator, and should be carried out within the limits of mutual communication. In order to avoid unnecessary felling when a part of the alignment has to be modified due to unexpected obstacles, prior felling of obstructing trees should be limited to short sections and minimized.
### 10-14. Existing roads
When working in the vicinity of an existing road or using an existing road, unless otherwise instructed, make every effort to maintain the road in the same condition as before the work and restore it to its original condition afterwards.
### 10-15. Protection of public property
Take necessary measures in advance to prevent damage or destruction of public facilities such as village roads, forest roads, forest specialized roads, and ditches. Bark, branches, leaves, soil, and other materials generated by the project should not be left in the vicinity of public facilities, but should be cleaned up and restored to their original condition.

## 11. Disposal of forest residues
### 11-1. Ball cutting
The contractor shall cut off the branches and stems of trees that will not be transported. The length of the cutting shall be 4m or less as a standard.        
### 11-2. Waste disposal site
The contractor shall dispose of unused wood and branches so that they are scattered throughout the forest. The contractor shall dispose of unused wood and branches in such a way that they are scattered throughout the forest, making the area between the wood and the ground as large as possible. However, in order to prevent runoff during floods, they should never be left in areas with catchment terrain, such as valley sides and near streams.

### 12. About mountain soil sites
### In the event of a flooding, do not leave logs in the catchment area.
### 12-1. Contact with lumbering personnel ### 12-2.
### 12-2. Piling
The height of the pile should be less than 2.5 m. In some cases, a stand should be used to prevent slipping. The height of the piles should be 2.5 m or less. However, if there are no houses or traffic around, the height should be 3 m or less.

## 13. Construction standards for land preparation, planting, and mowing 
Construction standards for land preparation, planting, and mowing ### 13-1.
Construction standards for land preparation, planting, and mowing shall be in accordance with the separate special specifications.
